# containers
implementation of part of the STL library

### Implemented:

[std::vector](./vector) standard language features.

[std::stack](./stack) on vector.

[std::map](./map) on red-black tree.

[std::set](./set) also on red-black tree.

# Usage
Benchmarks are written for each container to compare the speed of the standard library and its own implementation

``` 
./<the required container>/test.sh 
```

All tests can be viewed in the files main.cpp.
For example [Vector Tests](./vector/main.cpp)
